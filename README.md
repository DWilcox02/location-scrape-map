# location-scrape-map

Scrapes location details from 
https://www.tourisme-colmar.com/en/visit/presentation/architectural-heritage
and maps them using folium - written in python for my own personal use

Run ''geolocate.py'' to get scrape location details and save them to csv

Run ''map.py'' to read the existing csv and then map

Separated because ''geolocate.py'' is relatively slow
